# Checkdown

This program simply launches the first argument (a domain name) in anonymouse on firefox. 

It is primarily useful for checking if your a domain name is resolving properly, or checking if your favorite web site is *really* down. 

Other options maybe in the future.

Thanks. Contributors Welcome.
